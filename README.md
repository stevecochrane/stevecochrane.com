[stevecochrane.com](http://stevecochrane.com) has been my personal space on the internet since I was a college student 
back in 2005, and the site is now in its sixth design iteration.

### Setup
Assuming you already have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, navigate to the base directory with a command line 
interface and do this:

```bash
npm install
gulp
```

### Notes
* The CSS is written in the [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) style but if I were writing it today, it would be like 
  [SUIT CSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md) instead.
* The JavaScript is a little embarrassing but I haven't gotten around to updating it. jQuery really isn't necessary 
  here.
