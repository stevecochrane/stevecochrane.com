# stevecochrane.com

[stevecochrane.com](http://stevecochrane.com) has been my personal space on the internet since I was a college student 
back in 2005, and the site is now in its sixth design iteration.

Notes:
* My [portfolio](http://stevecochrane.com/portfolio/) and [blog](http://blog.stevecochrane.com/) aren't in here yet as 
  they have entirely separate code, but I would like to merge them in at some point.
* The CSS is written in the [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) style but if I were writing it today, it would be like 
  [SUIT CSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md) instead.
* The JavaScript is a little embarrassing but I haven't gotten around to updating it. jQuery really isn't necessary 
  here.
