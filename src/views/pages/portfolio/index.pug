							p It also makes heavy use of CSS3 animation for a page-turning effect, and despite being heavily textured, it is (mostly) optimized for high-resolution screens and it scales to fit screens of any size.

							p Vidcaster&apos;s navigation structure had remained essentially unchanged since its inception a few years ago and it was long overdue for an update. We started with an audit of all of the pages in the application, then we mapped out on paper a revised structure and where each page might go, and with that I iterated on visual design variations while collecting feedback.
							p The most common complaint about the previous design was that it took too many steps to move around the app, so with this design the sections can be expanded and collapsed for instant access to any page in one step. We also use a sidebar to optimize screen space for widescreen displays, and when there isn&apos;t enough space available we have an alternate layout with navigation across the top.

							ul
								li Analytics integrations with Google Analytics and Mixpanel
								li Interactivity integrations with HapYak
								li Advertising integrations with LiveRail and Brainient
								li Social media sharing from within the player
								li An interactive transcript
							p I also designed and developed two custom themes, &ldquo;Vidcaster Default&rdquo; and &ldquo;One Button,&rdquo; and I&apos;ve made multiple contributions to the VideoJS core which are in the process of being integrated into the next release. Some of the above customizations are also available as open source on #[a(href="https://github.com/vidcaster/", target="_blank") Vidcaster&apos;s GitHub page].

							p While it&apos;s nothing special from a game design or visual perspective, it was made from scratch with JavaScript and it utilizes every HTML5 feature I could throw in there, including canvas (of course), audio, cache manifest support for offline play, local storage support for high score storage, and touch controls for mobile devices. It not only continues to work over two years later, it works better thanks to improvements in JavaScript performance.
