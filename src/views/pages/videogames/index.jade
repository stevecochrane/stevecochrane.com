                p A game about climbing mountains, parenting, and hams. This is still a work in progress but I #[a(href="http://blog.stevecochrane.com/") blog] about its development (among other things) and there is some #[a(href="/music/") music] available as well.

                p My second entry for the #[a(href="http://ludumdare.com/") Ludum Dare] 48-hour game jam, made in August 2013. A frantic match-three puzzle game that explains what instigated the alien invasion in Space Invaders. It ranked in the top 10% of 1,400+ entries in the Fun category and very nearly so in Audio and Overall (top 11%).

                p My first entry for the #[a(href="http://ludumdare.com/") Ludum Dare] 48-hour game jam, made in April 2012. This is an 8-bit, two-player version of curling, set in outer space for no good reason. It ranked in the top 100 out of 1,400+ entries in the Fun, Audio, and Humor categories.

                p My first videogame, made from scratch with HTML5 in April 2011. While it&apos;s not much of a game (it&apos;s basically Space Invaders plus a new weapon, minus some other stuff) I am pretty proud of it from a technical perspective. It still runs on desktop browsers, though the mobile-specific functionality is now broken due to browser changes, sadly.
