					p A wide, serifed, tiny (7px tall) pixel font, made for retro-styled videogames and inspired by western and Clarendon typefaces. Intended for font sizes divisible by 8. Some manual kerning with awkward letter pairs like WA and AV might be necessary as kerning tables weren&apos;t implemented.
					p Marietta Seven is public domain so do with it what you want! This was made with the amazing #[a(href="http://fontstruct.com") FontStruct].

					p An even tinier (5px tall) pixel font, in the same style as Marietta Seven. Also intended for font sizes divisible by 8, and it works pretty well on an 8x8 pixel grid if monospacing is needed. Pairs well (naturally) with Marietta Seven. Marietta Five is also public domain and was also made with #[a(href="http://fontstruct.com") FontStruct].
