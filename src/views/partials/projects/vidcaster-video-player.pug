				p.
					Being a video service provider, Vidcaster needed a world-class video player. To that end we worked with the
					Brightcove team, started with their excellent open source
					#[a(href="http://videojs.com", target="_blank") VideoJS] video player as a base, and then extended it with the
					following new features:
				ul
					li Analytics integrations with Google Analytics and Mixpanel
					li Interactivity integrations with HapYak
					li Advertising integrations with LiveRail and Brainient
					li Social media sharing from within the player
					li Interactive transcripts
				p.
					I also designed and built two custom themes, “Vidcaster Default” and “One Button,” and I made multiple
					contributions to the VideoJS core.
