					When I was looking to apply for my current position at Blizzard, their job listing mentioned experience with
					JavaScript MVC frameworks such as Angular, Ember, etc. as a nice-to-have, and I hadn’t used any of those
					before, so before applying I decided to improve my chances and quickly made this.

					Pixel Art Scrapbook is a prototype of a web application for cataloguing pixel art that inspires you, for
					reference when you make your own. It uses Ember for MVC, Node &amp; Express for a simple RESTful API and
					MongoDB for the database. The demo here is just of the interface and the back-end functionality has been
					disabled. You can make changes but nothing is stored. The full version is
					#[a(href="https://github.com/stevecochrane/pixel-art-scrapbook") available on GitHub] but you’ll need to run a
					local Node server to use it.
