				p.
					Vidcaster was a platform for building custom video websites, sort of like YouTube channels but much more
					personalized, with full control over site layout and with business-oriented features like pay-per-view. Some of
					our more famous clients included Airbnb and VMware.
				p.
					Probably the coolest part of our platform was the Theme Editor, which was where you could choose from one of
					Vidcasterâ€™s themes, customize colors and images, and make changes to any of the templates. All of these
					changes were immediately reflected in a full-size preview of the&nbsp;site.
