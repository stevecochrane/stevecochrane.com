			p.
				I was one of a handful of front-end engineers who worked on a top-to-bottom redesign of the World of Warcraft
				website, in preparation for the launch of the Legion expansion. The site follows a lot of modern front-end best
				practices. It’s beautiful at any screen size, and it’s built with reusable components, designed to function as
				predictably and independently as possible.
			p.
				For the previous iteration of the site, there was a lot of repetition in code throughout, and a lot
				of minor variations on things, resulting in a lack of consistency and maintenance issues. We also had style
				guides in the past, but they never lasted long. So when we started, I identified living style guides as a way
				to solve these issues, researched best practices, and made our living style guide, along with establishing
				CSS and Less coding conventions for our team. It was the first living style guide at Blizzard Web &amp; Mobile,
				and now all of our sites have one.
