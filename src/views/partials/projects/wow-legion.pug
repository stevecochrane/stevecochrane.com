				p.
					Iâ€™m proud to say that I was given the opportunity to work on the announcement site for World of Warcraft:
					Legion, an expansion for one of the most successful games of all time. This was a very challenging and
					fulfilling project, with lush visuals and lots of video.
				p.
					I worked with four extremely talented designers for the duration of the project, and I was the sole engineer up
					until the last couple weeks when I had some additional help to polish and ship the site. The launch of the site
					was timed with our announcement of Legion at Gamescom 2015 in Cologne, Germany.
