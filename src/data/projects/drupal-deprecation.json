		"<p>Tableau Public was originally a Drupal site. With an aging Drupal 7 instance that needed critical updates and a diminished number of Drupal contributors on our team, we decided to remove our dependency on Drupal and make updates to our information architecture in the process.</p>",
		"<p>Drupal was used in a lot of places, so there was a significant amount of planning involved to determine what would need to be replaced, what to replace it with, and who would own the new features going forward. The implementation was a significant effort that required around ten different pages to be rebuilt, updates to our forms with new legal requirements, a new announcement banner, changes to how we host our videos, and more.</p>",
		"<p>For this project I was an individual contributor, and I either built or contributed to several very visible features such as the new homepage masthead, the new header and footer, and more. While making contributions I was also very active in reviewing the work of the team. As our subject matter expert for styling and CSS, I mentored others to make sure we got all of the design details just right.</p>"
