		"<p>When I was looking to apply for my current position at Blizzard, their job listing mentioned experience with JavaScript MVC frameworks such as Angular, Ember, etc. as a nice-to-have, and I hadn’t used any of those before, so before applying I decided to improve my chances and quickly made this.</p>",
		"<p>Pixel Art Scrapbook is a prototype of a web application for cataloguing pixel art that inspires you, for reference when you make your own. It uses Ember for MVC, Node & Express for a simple RESTful API and MongoDB for the database. The demo here is just of the interface and the backend functionality has been disabled. You can make changes but nothing is stored. The full version is <a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://github.com/stevecochrane/pixel-art-scrapbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available on GitHub</a> but you’ll need to run a local Node server to use it.</p>"
