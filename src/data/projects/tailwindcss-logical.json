		"<p>tailwindcss-logical is a plugin for <a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://tailwindcss.com\">Tailwind CSS</a> that adds support for CSS Logical Properties and Values. In short, this enables you to use the same styles for both left-to-right and right-to-left languages, by abstracting away explicit directions such as left and right.</p>",
		"<p>I wasnâ€™t the first to think of this and there were a few other plugins for CSS Logical Properties and Values out there, but tailwindcss-logical is now the most popular. I think this is because I gave it a clear scope, followed the official spec to make sure it was comprehensive, and took the time to write extensive documentation. I also made maintainability a priority by including an automated test suite for full coverage of all functionality.</p>",
		"<p>Those efforts have paid off, as the plugin was featured in the newsletters <a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://frontendfoc.us/issues/485\">Frontend Focus</a> and <a class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/tailwind-weekly/issues/tailwind-weekly-44-quiet-week-but-something-s-brewing-418129\">Tailwind Weekly</a>, and it holds a steady average of around 1,000 downloads a week on NPM, with a one-time peak of 5,000.</p>"
