		"<p>Vidcaster was a platform for building custom video websites, sort of like YouTube channels but much more personalized, with full control over site layout and with business-oriented features like pay-per-view. Some of our more famous clients included Airbnb and VMware.</p>",
		"<p>Probably the coolest part of our platform was the Theme Editor, which was where you could choose from one of Vidcasterâ€™s themes, customize colors and images, and make changes to any of the templates. All of these changes were immediately reflected in a full-size preview of the&nbsp;site.</p>",
