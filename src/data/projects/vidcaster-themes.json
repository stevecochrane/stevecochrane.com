		"<p>As a platform for building video sites, Vidcaster needed a large library of quality site themes that served a variety of different needs. I designed and built several of these myself while also being a resource for our network of theme design contractors.</p>",
		"<p>Launch was one of the flashier Vidcaster themes and it was made with the introduction of a new product in mind. It greatly emphasizes one video in particular (perfect for an introduction or product launch) and all other videos are playable on a single page.</p>",
		"<p>Obsidian was another public theme I made for Vidcaster. The idea for this one was to make something with dark colors by default, since all of our themes to that point had light color schemes, so I went with a central idea of “volcanic rock” and went from there.</p>",
		"<p>Carbon was the last theme I made, designed for businesses with large video libraries. We went beyond our usual sorted-by-recency list and added ways to browse by show and category. There was also a focus on the content itself, with large promotional images and minimal design&nbsp;ornamentation.</p>"
